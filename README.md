Hanbo Qiu's homework1

Promblem 1:This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.

part 1:Create a data frame comprised of:

A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
A (length-10) character vector
A (length-10) factor vector

part 2:Try to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe

It shows that mean function can work well for numeric and logical vectors but doesn't work for    characteristic vectors and vectors as factors.

part 3:convert variables from one type to another

Problem 2:This problem focuses on plotting and the use of inline R code.

part 1:Create a data frame comprised of:

x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
A logical vector indicating whether the x + y > 0
A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

part 2: A short description of my vector

part3: Make a scatterplot of y vs x

part 4: Export my first scatterplot
