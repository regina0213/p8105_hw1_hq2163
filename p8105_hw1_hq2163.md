Problem 1
---------

### This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.

### Create a data frame for Problem 1:

``` r
set.seed(2163)

dataframe_problem1 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10, sd = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 2,
  vec_char = c("Please", "list", "the", "American", "people's", "top", "four", "most", "popular", "sports"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("football", "basketball", "baseball", "ice_hockey", "football", "basketball", "baseball", "ice_hockey", "football", "basketball"))
)
```

### Try to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe:

``` r
mean(dataframe_problem1$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 0.83126

``` r
mean(dataframe_problem1$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(dataframe_problem1$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(dataframe_problem1$vec_char): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(dataframe_problem1$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(dataframe_problem1$vec_factor): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   It shows that the mean of vec\_numeric is 0.83126
-   It shows that the mean of vec\_logical is 0.3
-   It shows that mean function can work well for numeric and logical vectors but doesn't work for characteristic vectors and vectors as factors.

### convert variables from one type to another:

``` r
as.numeric(dataframe_problem1$vec_logical)
as.numeric(dataframe_problem1$vec_char)
as.numeric(dataframe_problem1$vec_factor)
```
