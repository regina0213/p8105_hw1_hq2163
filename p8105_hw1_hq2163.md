Problem 1
---------

### This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.

### Create a data frame for Problem 1:

``` r
set.seed(2163)

dataframe_problem1 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10, sd = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 2,
  vec_char = c("Please", "list", "the", "American", "people's", "top", "four", "most", "popular", "sports"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("football", "basketball", "baseball", "ice_hockey", "football", "basketball", "baseball", "ice_hockey", "football", "basketball"))
)
```
